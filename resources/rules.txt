                      SOS INDUCTION ROUND II RULES
                     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


1. The candidate agrees to not to share the questions asked in this
   interview, written or oral and understands that if they share these
   questions they will be immediately disqualified and also barred from
   all future inductions
2. Once the candidate decrypts `questions.txt', they have *strictly* 30
   minutes to answer the questions
3. The candidate may freely search the web for answers during this time
4. The candidate is however not allowed to consult or contact any
   external parties during the interview, and doing so will warrant
   disqualification
5. Using AI (like ChatGPT) is also not allowed
6. Interviewers may ask the candidate questions about their answers
   during and after this period, and the candidate may request the
   interviewer for 5 extra minutes in the event that a lot of time is
   spent answering these questions. It is up to the interviewer to
   accept or reject this request
7. Each question is worth *10 points*
8. There is partial marking for questions, however it nets significantly
   fewer points than fully solving a question
9. The candidate may freely pick questions and switch between them,
   however they must announce the question they are solving to the
   interviewer and explain their process for solving it
10. In case of poor internet connectivity or other emergencies, a
    candidate may apply for a make-up interview. This interview will be
    significantly harder, and will be allotted on a case-by-case basis
    after heavy deliberation
